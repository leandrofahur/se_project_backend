<h2>🥷 <strong>Github Best Practices</strong></h2>

<strong>Clone the repository:</strong>

```javascript
$ git clone https://github.com/leandrofahur/se_project_backend.git
```

<strong>Create your own branch:</strong>

```javascript
$ git checkout -b  <branch_name>
```

If you are in the main branch, this command will copy the main one and create a new branch named <branch_name>.

<strong>Staging, commiting and pushing:</strong>

```javascript
$ git add .
```

```javascript
$ git commit -m "a comment describing what this commit is about"
```

```javascript
$ git push
```

If you are pushing for the first time, git will ask you to execute the command

```javascript
$ git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>
```

Where the <branch_name> tag is the name of your local branch that is going to be created on the remote repository.

<strong>Always keep things up to date:</strong>

```javascript
$ git pull
```

If you are pulling for the first time, git will ask you to execute a command similar to the one listed for push.

<strong>Wrapping up:</strong>

After finishing your work, and the branch is ready to merge with master, execute the following:

```javascript
$ git checkout master
```

and then

```javascript
$ git merge <branch_name>
```

<strong>Delete branch locally</strong>

```javascript
$ git branch -d localBranchName
```

<strong>Delete branch remotely</strong>

```javascript
$ git push origin --delete remoteBranchName
```
